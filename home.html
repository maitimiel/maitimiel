	<h2>Hi there!</h2>
	
	<p>I'm maitimiel and I occasionally write fic and I occasionally like to make small websites for myself. I got a bit out of the habbit of fandom for a few years, but this personal archive felt like something I should make, specially since so many social media websites have come and gone over the years. Hopefully whatever happens in the future, you can always still find me on this corner!</p>
	
	<p>A few places where you can find me online:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Tumblr, on maitimiel.tumblr.com</li>
		<li>AO3, on archiveofourown.org/users/maitimiel</li>
